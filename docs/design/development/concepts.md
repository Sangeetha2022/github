# Geppetto Concepts


## Background/Motivation

The ideas for Geppetto are rooted in the fact that building modern software systems/apps is both complex and filled with boiler plate code!

Geppetto attempts to simplify development by providing  tooling, processes and frameworks to decrease the amount of time that a developer has to write code that has been written thousands of times in the industry.

Along the way towards building Geppetto, the ideas and the market segment around Low Code platforms began to take root and the developers of Geppetto realized that their goal of increasing reusability could be adapted to the nascent Low Code industry.

Once the connection to Low Code platforms was realized, the designers of Geppetto decided that they wanted their platform to be completely based on open source components, but to also create Applications that were also completely based on open source code and be Cloud Native from the start - this was the birth to Geppetto as "The Cloud Native Low Code Platform"

## It all starts with an Entity

In its most basic form all business software deals with the manipulation of Data.  
When you use Facebook, get paid at work (electronically!), or use a calory tracker to make sure you don't gain weight, you are manipulating or consuming data.
