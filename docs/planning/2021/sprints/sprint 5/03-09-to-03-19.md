# Sprint plan Tuesday March 09 to Friday March 19

## General Notes

***

1. losing Manavalan to PluralSight project early in the sprint
2. lost Mithun although he is staying at 10d

***

## Sprint completion notes

- Recursive UI Problem - made a lot of headway towards solving
  1. George was able to create 2 and three column screens
  2. late in the sprint ran into issues with Dynamic drops downs not sure if the issues were solved
  3. George did make enough progress to start on permitting the end user to modify the template within Geppetto

- Automatic deployment using Githubactions and Fargate
  1. good progress we think all code has been completed to enable this
  2. all local tests using Manavalan personal GitHub account were successful
  3. completed code to create private repo and pull creds from vault
  4. Auto deployment position us to charge for Geppetto usage
  5. [Auto deploy design doc](https://github.com/dan-castillo/geppettotest/tree/dev/docs/design/deployment_manager)

- RBAC
  1. Mithun completed all the changes for RBAC to be fully baked into generated applications
  2. this was a critical step towards completing the Ticket app

- Red Template
  1. there was confusing as to what was the Red Template
  2. Dan/Venkat thought that the Red Template was a telco temple
  3. the reality was that the "red" template was nothing more than the HP template with a "RED" line
  4. it was added to Geppetto generation but we should NOT use this
  5. good news was that it provided the chance to create document walking through developer on adding a templates which will be used when the next set of template are ready to be added
  6. [Template Instructions](https://github.com/dan-castillo/geppettotest/blob/dev/docs/design/template_document/add_new_template_documentation.md)

- Next version of ticket app
  1. the components that were needed for the second version took to long to complete the two components are: (RBAC, Recursive Algorithm)
  2. since the components above are believed to be completed next version of the ticket app will be attempted early in the next sprint
  3. completed design of Modifiers meta data concept - this is crucial as it allows the person using Geppetto to modify Flows in this case GpSearch and GpGetAll based on UserID and or other attributes
  4. The modifier concept is also needed to allow for landing screens to display data based on userid - a use case for this is displaying Graphs and Charts based on the user 

- New templates
  1. Arjit completed the HTML/CSS work for two new templates (Mrs. Travel and WeConnect)
  2. we will keep the templates on hold util we have developers with enough experience to add them to Geppetto

- Infra
  1. solved attaching volumes to Fargate tasks using spot instances - this is key to lowering our cost so that we can charge low enough for auto deployments to be competitive

  - Freshers
    1. Vignesh completed node course and is moving onto Typescript
    2. Chandra joined at the end of the sprint Wednesday March 3rd but has already completed 4 sections of the Node course

***

## Goal/notes for Sprint

1. start BETA-05
2. Ticket App with 3 column layout and RBAC - this was substatially completed at the end of sprint 4 but not tested
3. start test automatic deployments - will be impacted by Manavalan moving out to other project
4. complete template editing within Geppetto
5. create two more templates beyond WeConnect and Mrs. Travel

## UX Assignments

Please note: look for specifics tasks in Github this just gives the overall goals for each team member



- Arjit
 
## Developer Assignments

Please note:

- Look for specifics tasks in Github this just gives the overall goals for each team member
- Definition of complete: The functionality is available live in STAGE

- JP
  - Complete modifiers
  - hour of Power RBAC - THIS IS  MORE IMPORTANT SINCE MITHUN IS LEAVING!
  - add static type drop down
    1. did not start - focused shifted to Modifiers
  - bugs - do we have any that are major blockers?
    - admin screen
      1. focused shifted to Modifiers
    - landing page
      1. focused shifted to Modifiers
  - finish ticketing app - Potential changes could be:
    - lets talk what is left todo that would be more important than hour of power
    - add ckEditor
    - add history
    - add notifications (MailChimp)
    - add file attachments
    1. focused shifted to Modifiers

 
- Manavalan
  - finish aws deployment manager for generated app
    1. completed
    2. using this process/code he started the auto-deployment tasks
  
  - finish analysis of route 53 cli for auto creation of DNS for generated apps using geppettosoftware.io domain
    1. this was not started - it was decided to auto-deploy first with just the IP address
  - maybe landing screen (only if auto deployments are completed)
    1. auto-deployments took precedent
  - hour of Power aws training - #822
    1. auto-deployments took precedent

- George
  - analyze the issue with recursive algorithm
    - create a design before we code - we only want to do this once
    - refactor the template code to allow for the ability to remove a template from the deployment - this is needed to allow for deployments to enterprise customers with only their templates are shipped/deployed - see the HP problem!
    - the recursive problem is in the same area of the code as the shipping template problem

- Vignesh
  - learn node
  - start to use containers for development
  - install Geppetto and help test
