## UX Assignments

Please note to look for specifics tasks in Github this just gives the overall goals for each team member

- Arjit
  - using Geppetto screen designer create a professional Tkt app
    - point out which components are missing that were is Grapedrop
  - continue developing static pages and add more templates until we get to nine (9) total

## Developer Assignments

Please note to look for specifics tasks in Github this just gives the overall goals for each team member

- JP
  - priority bugs as they arise
  - start the Connector framework
    - create design document describing how the flows/micro flows are used in the generation process specifically how and where they are used in the Workers and Workers Helpers
    - work/coordinate with Krishnakumar
    - connectors will now need their own generation manager in order to generate their configurations
      - when generating the ConnectorGenManager generates everything captured in the Newman collection **EXCEPT** credentials
      - all credentials for using a connector need to be added at runtime on the generated application ADMIN screen
      - we need a generation manager that can generate the application's Admin page, this is not the same as Admin-manager
        - JP and Dan to talk this AdminGenManager - Mithun might have worked on this for WCMX
    - connectors need to be "attached" to a microflow and not the flow
    - refactor connector object
      - the connector object should have the basic information needed by a POSTMAN collection
      - get rid off "defaultConnector" file
      - add a "type" attribute to connector object
      - add a property called "call-from" this property captures which "area" "front-end" or "back-end" the "call" is made from
      - "call-from" only here to support the Lalit (migration) use case where they only want to call from the "front-end" most of the time the call to an external api/system will be from the back-end/microservices

  - Manavalan
    - work JP on the first portion of Connectors
      - microflow object and design
      - microflow needs to be "attached" to the microflow step instead of the Flow component object
      - when we generate the "external-type" microflows the admin screen manager/generator needs to
      be changed to allow for the security credentials for the external APIs to be save in a local DB  and
      accessed via the generated application admin screen

  - Krishnakumar
    - work with JP on Connectors
      - collection upload for Newman testing
      - test with the following public apis:
        - MLSGrid - this API returns a huge object (over 100 fields) but its only searchable no updates
        - Twilio - this we can do CRUD plus we have done this before
        - Hangout - we could use this in the future
      - use and enhance gepFileManager for file upload - [gepFileManager](https://github.com/dan-castillo/gepFileManager/tree/dharanya_dev)
      - entity creation using Newman results

  - Harish
    - work with JP to attach CloneManager to front end **this is low priority**
    - complete CloneManager back end
      - need to add a field to Project model/collection called "share-visibility"
      - share-visibility values
        - "shared-to-all" - indicates that the project can be seen by all users
        - for other shared values - use the values in the default User object (speak with Dan first)
    - hour of power
      - start learning Angular

- Naveenkumar
  - add a template to Geppetto and use them to generate the tkt app

- Arunodhayam
  - finish typescript
  - add a template to Geppetto

- Bala
  - learn async/await in node
  - install geppetto locally - as of Friday 4/23 did not have a machine with 16GB
  - add WeConnect to Geppetto including the generator
    - must solve the side navigation problem for all templates (speak with JP or George)


- Sundarapandeeswar
  - learn Angular
  - install Geppetto locally
  - familiarize yourself with Screen designer
  - start to learn GrapesJS
  - the end goal for this learning is to migrate Geppetto front end to latest version of Angular (12)

- Surendar
  - learn Angular
  - install Geppetto locally
  - familiarize yourself with Screen designer
  - start to learn GrapesJS
