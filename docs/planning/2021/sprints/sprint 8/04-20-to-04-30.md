## Developer Assignments

Please note to look for specifics tasks in Github this just gives the overall goals for each team member

- JP

  - priority bugs as they arise
  - start the Connector frame work
    - create design document describing how the flows/micro flows are used in the generation process specifically how and where they are used in the Workers and Workers Helpers
    - work/coordinate with Krishnakumar
    - connectors need to be "attached" to a microflow and not the flow
    - refactor connector object
      - the connector object should have the basic information needed by a POSTMAN collection
      - get rid off "defaultConnector" file
      - add a "type" attribute to connector object
      - add a property called "call-from" this property captures which "area" "front-end" or "back-end" the "call" is made from
      - this is only here to support the Lalit (migration) use case where they only want to call from the "front-end" most of the time the call to an external api/system will be from the back-end/microservices
    question: there are the two collections for flow: project flows and project flow component

  - Harish
    - work with JP to attach CloneManager to front end **this is low priority**
    - complete CloneManager back end
      - need to add a field to Project model/collection called "share-visibility"
      - share-visibility values
        - "shared-to-all" - indicates that the project can be seen by all users
        - for other shared values - use the values in the default User object (speak with Dan first)
    - stretch goal - add a template to Geppetto
    - hour of power
      - start learning Angular

  - Naveenkumar
    - THIS DEPENDS ON A CONVERSATION WITH THOMAS

      - we need to send notifications via email (MailChimp)
      - **start the work on the SEF** this is very challenging specially for a fresher
