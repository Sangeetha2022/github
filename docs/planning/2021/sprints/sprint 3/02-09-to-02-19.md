# Sprint plan Tuesday Feb 09 to Friday Feb 19

## Sprint completion notes

1. completed thirty three (33) tasks
2. rolled over 20 tasks - keep in mind this is not accurate - adding it in here as a training/discipline
3. completed the generation of type 1 dynamic drop downs - big milestone
4. first cut of ticket app 
5. all the UX tasked rolled over to  next sprint both UX people were assigned other projects

## Goal/notes for Sprint

We lost key people to either leave or other projects - specifically:

- Manikandan - although not key, adding him to this list for completes

1. start of BETA-03
