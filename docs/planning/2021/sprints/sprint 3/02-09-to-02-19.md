    - analyze shared app manager - this is how we can "share" the ticket app - this should be done AFTER landing screen

- Manavalan
  - he was out sick Tuesday Feb 16
  - finish aws deployment manager for generated app - this should have been and EPIC because it rolled over to next sprint
  - finish analysis of route 53 cli for auto creation of DNS for generated apps using geppettosoftware.io domain - was this started?
  - hour of Power aws training - #822
  - if by chance you end up with free time (I doubt it) - start to learn how to add a new template # 3 - this was silly even to add here - given that the other two task were so large
