- JP
  - bugs - do we have any that are major blockers?
  - finish ticketing app - Potential changes could be:
    - add the css from Arun/Arjit
    - add ckEditor
    - add history
    - add notifications (MailChimp)
    - add file attachments
  - hour of Power RBAC - THIS MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT SINCE MITHUN IS LEAVING!
    - design how to implement field level RBAC on front end
    - design how to implement RBAC at the Microservice level
  - what about Quick Connectors?

- Mithun
  - potential to move into sprint
    - add red template
    - landing screen #855
    - analyze shared app manager - this is how we can "share" the ticket app - this should be done AFTER landing screen

- Manavalan
  - finish aws deployment manager for generated app
  - finish analysis of route 53 cli for auto creation of DNS for generated apps using geppettosoftware.io domain  
  - hour of Power aws training - #822

- George
  - analyze the issue with recursive algorithm
    - create a design before we code - we only want to do this once
    - refactor the template code to allow for the ability to remove a template from the deployment - this is needed to allow for deployments to enterprise customers with only their templates are shipped/deployed - see the HP problem!
    - the recursive problem is in the same area of the code as the shipping template problem
