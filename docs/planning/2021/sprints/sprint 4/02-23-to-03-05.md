## Developer Assignments

Please note to look for specifics tasks in Github this just gives the overall goals for each team member

- JP
  - add red template
  - hour of Power RBAC - THIS IS  MORE IMPORTANT SINCE MITHUN IS LEAVING!

  - maybe landing screen (only if auto deployments are completed)
  - hour of Power aws training - #822

- George
  - analyze the issue with recursive algorithm
    - create a design before we code - we only want to do this once
    - refactor the template code to allow for the ability to remove a template from the deployment - this is needed to allow for deployments to enterprise customers with only their templates are shipped/deployed - see the HP problem!
    - the recursive problem is in the same area of the code as the shipping template problem
