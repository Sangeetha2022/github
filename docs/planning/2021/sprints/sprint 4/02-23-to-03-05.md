    1. added a template but it WAS NOT the Telco template there was confusion - what was added was the HP template with a RED line (ugh)
    2. good news - document was created that describes how to add a new template
  - hour of Power RBAC - THIS IS  MORE IMPORTANT SINCE MITHUN IS LEAVING!
  - add static type drop down
    1. did not start - focused shifted to Modifiers
  - bugs - do we have any that are major blockers?
    - admin screen
      1. focused shifted to Modifiers
    - landing page
      1. focused shifted to Modifiers

    - lets talk what is left todo that would be more important than hour of power
    - add ckEditor
    - add history
    - add notifications (MailChimp)
    - add file attachments
    1. focused shifted to Modifiers

- Mithun
  - finalize RBAC
    - solve 4 output issue - this was done, turned out to be config issues
    - change from Fetch to something that solves the issue - config issue
    - created add/manage user screen
      - refactor old tech debt - we were making calls directly from the UI to Camunda
    - admin screen?  - NOPE top work took all sprint
    - landing page  - NOPE top work took all sprint
  
- Manavalan
  - finish aws deployment manager for generated app
    1. completed
    2. using this process/code he started the auto-deployment tasks
  
  - finish analysis of route 53 cli for auto creation of DNS for generated apps using geppettosoftware.io domain
    1. this was not started - it was decided to auto-deploy first with just the IP address
  - maybe landing screen (only if auto deployments are completed)
    1. auto-deployments took precedent
  - hour of Power aws training - #822
    1. auto-deployments took precedent

- George
  - analyze the issue with recursive algorithm
    - create a design before we code - we only want to do this once
    - refactor the template code to allow for the ability to remove a template from the deployment - this is needed to allow for deployments to enterprise customers with only their templates are shipped/deployed - see the HP problem!
    - the recursive problem is in the same area of the code as the shipping template problem

- Vignesh
  - learn node
  - start to use containers for development
  - install Geppetto and help test
