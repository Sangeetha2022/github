    - create a design before we code - we only want to do this once
    - refactor the template code to allow for the ability to remove a template from the deployment - this is needed to allow for deployments to enterprise customers with only their templates are shipped/deployed - see the HP problem!
    - the recursive problem is in the same area of the code as the shipping template problem
