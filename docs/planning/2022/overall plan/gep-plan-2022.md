# Geppetto 2022

## Just capturing ideas as of 11-28-2021

### Go live

Need to go live with what you have:

- Angular screen creation
- React screen creation
- NodeJS Microservices
- Github actions for AWS deployment
- Sample applications
  - Tickets
  - ElectricGlide

### Shareable features

- architecture that allows for the addition of features to the generator
- gepTagManager, gepFileManager, gepForums, gepInventory, gepShoppingCart

### Government data as features

Create features that have government data that can be as easily integrated  into Geppetto applications
This will give Angular, React and Node developers the ability to add government data and visualizations into their apps

- example: [USAFACTS](https://usafacts.org/)

  - [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/developers/apis)
  - [CKAN Platform](https://ckan.org/)
